### Stability information

The newest release of Yoshida always supports everything used in the example [designs](https://github.com/XOYZ69/Yoshida/tree/master/data/card_designs) and [sets](https://github.com/XOYZ69/Yoshida/tree/master/data/card_sets) since they are getting tested with every commit.
If anything does not work please check if there are any new versions out or create a [new issue](https://github.com/XOYZ69/Yoshida/issues/new/choose).

With that said until Version 1.0 is released this program should be used with these things in mind.
